It considers 4 common distributions; Normal, Uniform, Exponential, and Beta, and looks at how the sample minimums and maximums are distributed. To see the distributions we used a sample size of n = 5, took the sample statistic, and repeated the simulation 5000 times to get a distribution of sample maxes or mins for our selected common distribution. The biggest takeaway from this project is understanding how the sample minimums and maximums of different distributions had their own distribution with its own characteristics. Mini-Project 2 is a unique assignment where we created a story based on a list of vocabulary terms relating to estimation. The project took terms used in the estimation unit and required their usage in a story in Math/Stat context. This project helped to develop a strong understanding of the terms in order to use them in the project. This project was a unique challenge, that gave us the opportunity to creatively explore terms from the estimator unit. These projects are largely unconnected, but some of the terms used in the meaningful story can apply to the sampling distributions. The distributions had variations in the consistency, and each common distribution had its own parameters to shape it. \n\nThe third mini-project looked at confidence intervals, and studied how the sample size assumption can effect coverage rate and interval width. We saw how intervals that failed the sample sample size assumption had significantly lower coverage rates, and interval widths that were significantly larger with more uncertainty. This project helped us build our understanding of how a violation of a sample size assumption can change the effectiveness of our formulas. This project is connected to project 1, as they both compare the spread of the simulated values. Project 1 considers the SE of Ymin and Ymax, while project 3 looks at the interval width of the confidence interval. We compare and contrast the different variability, and compare our expected values with calculated values as well. The use of different sample sizes leads to different interval widths, while the different SE in project 1 comes from the differences in the type of distribution having different expected maxes and mins. The random samples help to provide variation in the simulations, and allow us to see how different results are generated with different parameters.\n\nThe fourth mini-project works with Bayesian statistics and how prior distributions effect the posterior distributions. For this project we looked at data from Djokavic tennis serving, and compared 3 prior and posteriors to see how the data effected the posterior distributions. We looked at 3 priors with differing levels of variability and bias, and studied how the same data results in 3 different posteriors distribution. From this experiment, the more \"informed\" a prior distribution, the less effect data has on that distribution. This project has a strong connection to project 3, as we also included a 90% credible interval for each posterior distribution to see the possible variability in each. We saw that with the uninformed prior, the posterior had the widest credible interval. This relates to our findings in project 3 where a smaller sample size has a wider interval. Our uniformed prior has the least information and therefor has the widest interval. We also see with our most informed prior, the narrowest credible interval, again matching our project 3 findings with large sample sizes generating narrow interval width. This project also could relate to project 1, as it uses a beta distribution for the informed priors and posteriors, similar to the beta sampling distribution from project 1.\n\nThe fifth mini-project discusses a dilemma surrounding the p-value and its significance level of p<0.05. In this project we read some articles about the use of p<0.05 as a strict definition of significance, while it should instead be more of a guide of where to consider significance around. The articles make the point that a 0.002 difference in p-value should not determine whether something is significant or not, and notes the lack of logic behind this. In this project we consider issues, solutions, and the current state of affairs in relation to this dilemma. Overall, this project helped us form a better understanding of how we should think about p-values, and that their interpretation should not be dichotomous and restrictive of significance. This project relates strongly to the confidence interval project, as typically values outside the interval are considered significantly different than the sample statistic the interval is based on. It also relates to the fourth project, with the Bayesian credible intervals following along with the confidence intervals and leaving possibly significant values outside their range. These two methods are possibly better for understanding significant, as seeing values toward the edge of confidence intervals could indicate a possible statistic of interest in a study. \n\nOverall, these mini-projects helped to delved deeper into different areas of Math/Stat, and develop a better understanding of topics through different experiences. Writing out a story to illustrate estimator terms was a useful project that forced a deeper understanding of the specific vocabulary. Seeing different statistical concepts through simulation was also extremely useful, as understanding sample size assumptions of priors and posteriors is much easier visually and with a hands on approach.\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThis blog is a reflection of the 5 Math/Stat Mini-Projects, and a reflection of the connections between the projects.\n\nThe first mini-project looks at the sampling distribution of sample statistics besides the sample mean, in this case the sample minimum and maximum.
